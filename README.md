## ðŸš€ About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Floota
- Iâ€™m interested in software development, deployment and architecture as well as,  
    all things videogames, and how they're made.
- Iâ€™m currently learning GDScript, Angular and good practices to make my code cleaner   and more legible.

- I'm a full stack developer passionate about learning and will always be curious about how and why things work how they do.
